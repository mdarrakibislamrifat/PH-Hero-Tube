<div class="text-xl">
    <h1 class="text-4xl font font-semibold">Null and Undefined</h1>
    <p>Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</p>

    <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a set of architectural principles and constraints that are commonly used in web development to design networked applications. REST APIs are used to enable communication between different software systems over the internet.</p>
